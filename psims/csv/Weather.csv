WFDEI,The WFDEI meteorological forcing data set has been generated using the same methodology as the widely used WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) by making use of the ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The ERA-Interim reanalysis data have led to improvements in precipitation and wind speed data while the changes in the aerosol corrections have improved the downward shortwave fluxes. The WFDEI will allow more detailed comparisons of hydrological and Earth System model outputs with relevant satellite products than using the WFD.
ERA5,ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.
